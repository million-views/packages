# Home for packages - small and big

This repository is home to packages maintained by Million Views, LLC. The
packages include both in-house developed software and open source tools we've
adapted for our use.

Please refer to the individual license file within each package for specific
licensing details.

## Note to developers

For the inclusion of adapted open-source libraries in this repository,
**developers** must ensure that these are originally licensed under either MIT
or Apache style licenses, allowing users to utilize these libraries free of
copyleft restrictions.

Please provide credit where it is due. Even if an open source library was
adapted and changed extensively to serve a different purpose or audience, be
sure to credit the authors of the original library and provide a link to the
same somewhere in the README.
