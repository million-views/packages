# Home for packages - small and big

Million Views, LLC. The packages include both in-house developed
software and open source tools we've adapted for our use.

Please refer to the individual license file within each package for
specific licensing details. 

## Note to developers
For the inclusion of adapted open-source libraries in this
repository, **developers** must ensure that these are originally
licensed under either MIT or Apache style licenses, allowing users
to utilize these libraries free of copyleft restrictions.

Please provide credit where it is due. Even if an open source library
was adapted and changed extensively to serve a different purpose or
audience, be sure to credit the authors of the original library and
provide a link to the same somewhere in the README.
