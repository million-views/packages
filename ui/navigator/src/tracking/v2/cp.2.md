# Navigator Component Continuation Prompt (after centralizing use of icons, 15MAY2025)

## Project Context

We've been developing a redesigned Navigator component with:

1. A new API following principles of progressive complexity and
   composition-over-configuration
2. SSR-compatible implementation with proper state management
3. Theme system using CSS variables
4. Responsive behavior across device sizes
5. Icon rendering standardization using a required `renderIcon` prop

We've successfully implemented the core architecture but encountered issues with
demo apps not displaying the Navigator.

## Implementation Progress

- ✅ Type system with comprehensive definitions
- ✅ Context providers with SSR compatibility
- ✅ Theme system with Google News preset
- ✅ Component structure with proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Icon rendering system with centralized approach
- ❌ Demo applications from various domains show Navigator in action

## Inputs provided to you for context

1. Navigator API Design Document (wip)
2. Navigator API Design Validation (from a DX perspective)
3. Code from a failing demo apps

## The Ask

Figure out why the demo apps are not displaying the Navigator. DO NOT GENERATE
CODE. Your answer should be one of the following two:

1. It was a coding error and the fix is simple. Allow me to fix it and then we
   can proceed to refine the API
2. I have analysed the code and this demonstrates why we must first refine the
   API and then proceed to fix the demo apps
