Now, let's create the main index file to export everything:

Finally, let's create a utility file for backward compatibility with the old
API:

Now, let's create an example implementation with the new API:

Let's create an implementation plan for the remainder of the project:

# Navigator Component Redesign: Phase 1 Complete

I've successfully implemented the core infrastructure for our redesigned
Navigator component. This implementation delivers a flexible, SSR-safe
navigation system that can recreate the Google News UI patterns while
maintaining a minimal API surface area.

## What's Been Implemented

1. **Type System**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript definitions for all component props
   - Clear separation of concerns in the type hierarchy
   - Support for advanced customization patterns

2. **Context System**
   - Enhanced context providers with SSR compatibility
   - Centralized state management for responsive behavior and mobile menu
   - Proper theming context with CSS variable support

3. **Component Architecture**
   - Modular component structure with clear responsibilities
   - Component override system for targeted customization
   - Render props for maximum flexibility

4. **Responsive Behavior**
   - SSR-safe media query hooks
   - Breakpoint-based configuration
   - Context-aware responsive adaptations

5. **Theme System**
   - CSS variable-based theming
   - Google News preset theme
   - Comprehensive token system

6. **Initial Styling**
   - Clean, minimal CSS implementation
   - Mobile and desktop layouts
   - Support for various navigation patterns

7. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Adapter for legacy API support
   - Smooth migration path
   - Equivalent behavior between old and new APIs

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows our proposed approach:

1. **Parallel Implementation Structure**
   ```
   navigator/
   ├── src/    # Current implementation 
   └── next/   # New implementation
       ├── components/  # UI components
       ├── context/     # React contexts
       ├── hooks/       # Custom hooks
       ├── types/       # TypeScript definitions
       ├── utils/       # Utility functions
       └── examples/    # Example implementations
   ```

2. **Progressive API Complexity**
   - Simple use cases require minimal configuration
   - Advanced use cases supported through targeted customization
   - Clear, intuitive naming conventions

3. **Composition Over Configuration**
   - Component override system for targeted customization
   - Render props for full control
   - Context hooks for state access

4. **Theme-First Approach**
   - CSS variables for styling
   - Preset themes for common designs
   - Component-specific theme tokens

## Google News Implementation Example

The example implementation demonstrates how the new API can recreate the Google
News navigation with minimal code:

```tsx
<Navigator
  brand={{ logo: <GoogleLogo />, title: "News" }}
  navigation={[
    {
      id: "main",
      items: [
        { id: "home", label: "Home", path: "/" },
        { id: "foryou", label: "For you", path: "/foryou" },
        // More items...
      ],
    },
    {
      id: "categories",
      separator: true,
      items: [
        { id: "us", label: "U.S.", path: "/section/us" },
        { id: "world", label: "World", path: "/section/world" },
        // More items...
      ],
    },
  ]}
  actions={[
    { id: "search", icon: <SearchIcon />, type: "icon" },
    { id: "signin", label: "Sign in", type: "button", variant: "primary" },
  ]}
  responsive={{
    mobile: { primaryNav: "drawer", categoryNav: "tabs" },
    desktop: { primaryNav: "tabs", categoryNav: "tabs" },
  }}
  theme="google-news"
  router={router}
/>;
```

## Next Steps

The next phases of the implementation plan include:

1. **Testing & Refinement**
   - Unit and component tests
   - API refinement and edge case handling
   - Performance optimization

2. **Documentation & Examples**
   - Comprehensive API documentation
   - Migration guides
   - Additional real-world examples

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Accessibility enhancements
   - Animation system
   - Additional customization options

## Questions for Review

1. Does the current API design adequately balance flexibility with simplicity?
2. Are there any specific edge cases or patterns we should prioritize in Phase
   2?
3. Should we focus more on backward compatibility or lean into the new API
   design?
4. Any specific aspects of the Google News UI that we should refine further?

I'm ready to proceed with Phase 2 based on your feedback.
