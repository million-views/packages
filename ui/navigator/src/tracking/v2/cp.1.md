# Navigator Component Continuation Prompt (after redesign, 14MAY2025)

We've been working on redesigning a navigation component called "Navigator" with
an improved API. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished and what still
needs to be done.

## Current Status

We've created a new implementation with several key improvements:

1. **Improved Code Structure**:
   - Cleaner file organization in `next/` directory alongside the original
     implementation
   - Proper separation of types, contexts, components, hooks, and utilities
   - Fixed circular dependencies and naming inconsistencies

2. **Enhanced APIs**:
   - More intuitive navigation structure
   - Better theme system with constants and utilities
   - Improved responsive handling
   - Generic Drawer component (renamed from MobileDrawer)

3. **Key Components Implemented**:
   - Navigator (main component)
   - Header (top navigation bar)
   - Navigation (tabs navigation)
   - Drawer (side drawer for navigation)
   - Brand (logo and title component)
   - Actions (action buttons and menus)

## Next Step: Unit Testing

Our next priority is implementing unit tests for the core components and
utilities. We need to create tests for:

1. **Utility Functions**:
   - Theme utilities in `theme/utils.ts`
   - Component utilities in `utils/component.ts`

2. **Hooks**:
   - `useMediaQuery` - Tests should verify SSR compatibility and responsive
     behavior
   - `useResponsive` - Tests should check correct breakpoint detection
   - `useTheme` - Tests should confirm theme access and error handling

3. **Components**:
   - Basic rendering tests for each component
   - Interaction tests for interactive elements
   - Accessibility tests for navigation semantics

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test the complete Navigator with various configurations
   - Verify that components work together correctly

## Implementation Plan

We're following this implementation plan:

1. Phase 1: Core Implementation (COMPLETED)
2. Phase 2: Testing & Refinement (CURRENT PHASE)
3. Phase 3: Documentation & Examples
4. Phase 4: Additional Features

## References for Unit Testing

For our testing approach, we should set up:

1. **Jest** for unit testing
2. **React Testing Library** for component testing
3. **Mock objects** for context and hooks

## Principles to Follow

Throughout the implementation, we're adhering to these principles:

1. **No circular dependencies** - Components should not import from each other
2. **Clean file naming** - Avoid repeating folder names in file names
3. **Type safety** - Ensure proper TypeScript types for all components and
   functions
4. **SSR compatibility** - All components should work with server-side rendering
5. **Accessibility** - Navigation should meet WCAG guidelines

## Key Files and Their Locations

If you need to reference specific files, here's the current structure:

```
next/
├── components/
│   ├── Actions.tsx
│   ├── Brand.tsx
│   ├── Drawer.tsx (formerly MobileDrawer)
│   ├── Header.tsx
│   ├── Navigation.tsx
│   └── Navigator.tsx
├── context/
│   ├── Navigator.tsx
│   └── Theme.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── useMediaQuery.ts
│   ├── useResponsive.ts
│   └── useTheme.ts
├── theme/
│   ├── constants.ts
│   └── utils.ts
├── types/
│   └── index.ts
├── utils/
│   └── component.ts
└── index.ts
```

Please continue with implementing unit tests for our components, starting with
utilities and hooks.
