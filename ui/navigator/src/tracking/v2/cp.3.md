# Navigator Component Continuation Prompt (16MAY2025)

## Project Context & Progress

We've been refining the Navigator component API to improve developer experience
(DX) through a more composable, intuitive design.

### Major Changes Implemented:

1. **Composition-Based Architecture** - Moved from a configuration-based to
   composition-based pattern
2. **Component Renaming** - Changed Sidebar to Drawer with clearer mode
   terminology
3. **Responsive Integration** - Added automatic mobile adaptation
4. **React 19 Features** - Support for inline styles and better CSS structure

### Core Components Implemented:

- **Navigator** - Main container and context provider
- **Header** - Top navigation bar
- **Brand** - App branding section (with automatic mobile menu)
- **Drawer** - Side navigation panel with "temporary" and "persistent" modes
- **Actions** - Header actions and menus
- **Tabs** - Horizontal navigation tabs
- **Content** - Main content container (this is questionable if it should be
  part of the core, we may have to revisit the examples and see if they can own
  it; ideally the Navigator should not be in the business of rendering route
  contents)

### Current Component API:

```tsx
<Navigator
  brand={brandConfig}
  navigation={navigationData}
  router={routerAdapter}
  renderIcon={renderIcon}
  actions={actionsData}
  responsive={responsiveConfig}
  theme={theme}
  themeOverrides={themeOverrides}
>
  <Header>
    <Brand logo={logo} title="App Title" />
    <CustomContent />
    <Actions actions={actionsData} />
  </Header>

  <style>{/* React 19 component-scoped styles */}</style>

  <div className="layout">
    <Drawer mode="persistent" />
    <Content>
      <PageContent />
    </Content>
  </div>
</Navigator>;
```

## Current Status

We've successfully updated and tested the Dashboard and Documentation examples
with the new composition-based API. The other two examples (E-commerce, Google
News) still need updating.

## Next Steps

1. Update the remaining examples to use the composition-based API
2. Refine component APIs based on usage patterns discovered
3. Finalize naming and defaults for the best DX
4. Update CSS to ensure consistent styling across all components
5. Prepare comprehensive documentation with examples

## Technical Notes

- Each example exposes different aspects of the Navigator's capabilities
- The E-commerce example needs complex mega menu support
- The Documentation example requires TOC and multi-level navigation
- Google News example demonstrates tabs and contextual actions
- All examples require proper responsive behavior

## The Ask

Update the remaining examples (E-commerce, Google News) to use the new
composition-based API, identifying any further refinements needed to the
component interfaces. You can assume that any icons needed will be available in
the icons registry; so, do not waste tokens on generating svg icons.

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Maintain existing visual appearance and functionality (enhance but don't
   break)
2. Use the composition pattern consistently
3. Leverage React 19 features for styling
4. Apply proper responsive behavior in all examples
5. Note any API improvements or inconsistencies discovered

## Additional Context

Previous analysis highlighted several key requirements for the Navigator API:

- Clear component hierarchy and predictable rendering
- Unified styling system with theme support
- Intuitive responsive behavior without excessive configuration
- Support for common navigation patterns (tabs, drawers, menus)
- Integration with client routing systems

## Inputs being provided to you

- Dashboard Example (that has already been ported to use the new API) for your
  reference
- Documentation Example (that has already been ported to use the new API) for
  your reference
- E-Commerce Example that has to be ported/re-written using the new API
- Google News Example that has to be ported/re-written using the new API
- API Design Validation Document that should provide more context for you; if
  you need to look at the code (of the Naviagator, ask!)

---

You're right that the current implementation isn't correctly handling the
mutually exclusive display of horizontal vs. vertical navigation. This could
indeed point to a limitation in the API design, as it seems challenging to
coordinate these different navigation modes. Looking at the Navigator API, the
issue appears to be:

We're trying to conditionally render both tabs and drawer navigation based on
screen size The responsive configuration has a declarative format that doesn't
easily support complex conditions We need to ensure that only one navigation
style is visible at a time

Let me try a different approach where I:

Use the drawer for all navigation in the tablet view Completely hide the tabs on
tablet Only render the mobile category tabs on mobile (not tablet) Ensure the
tablet drawer is properly styled

The key is to use CSS media queries to hide/show components based on screen
size, rather than relying solely on the Navigator's responsive configuration.
