# Navigator Component Continuation Prompt (after many iterations...)

In our previous discussion/work session, we've designed a comprehensive
navigation system for React applications. We've established a balanced approach
that provides opinionated defaults while allowing targeted customization.

**## Key Features**

1. Compatible with SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
2. Work with React Router
3. Support multi-level navigation
4. Handle both mobile and desktop layouts
5. Be fully accessible and customizable
6. Minimal dependencies (TailwindCSS and DaisyUI is okay to use for styling, but
   no other dependencies if feasible)
7. Designed to work with code generated by `rr-check` tool from `rr-builder`
   package. (see `rr-check` generated code topic below)

**## Current Work Status**

- Core component and its composite part have been developed
- Documentation and usage examples are done

**## Current Implementation Status** The Navigator component now has a robust
structure with:

- Context-based state management
- SSR-safe code (no direct window references in rendering)
- Comprehensive theming system
- Icon support with fallbacks
- Mobile/desktop responsive design

**## Next Steps** In the continuation, we should in the order of priority:

1. Review code and ensure that it is SSR safe.
2. Review code and documentation to ensure they are in sync with each other.
3. Review design critically from the point of DX of a user of the `Navigator`
   and think hard on what can be simplified or eliminated.
4. Go wild and create demo apps that show cool customizations to illustrate how
   the core navigator functionality can be used by either using theme mechanism
   or by providing custom components (ask me for example screenshots that I have
   in mind).
5. Implement keyboard navigation and accessibility features.

Please review the attached code and documentation, pause, and ask questions
before proceeding with next steps.
