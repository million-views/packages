# File Structure

file structure to follow better naming practices, avoiding repetition of folder
names in the filenames. Here's the improved structure:

# Grind/Iterate: 2

You're absolutely right - that's a significant code smell that could easily lead
to circular dependencies. Having a child component import from a parent
component violates proper dependency hierarchies and component boundaries.

Let's fix this by moving `withOverride` to a shared utilities file that both
components can import from:

Now let's update the Brand component to import `withOverride` from the shared
utility file instead of from the Navigator component:

Let's also update the Navigator component to use the `withOverride` utility from
the shared file:

Let's also check and update the Actions component:

Let's check the Navigation component as well:

Let's also check the MobileDrawer component:

Finally, let's update the index.ts file to export the withOverride function from
its new location:

# Component Dependency Issues Fixed

## Key Fix: Removed Parent-Child Import Dependencies

The main issue was that Brand, Actions, Navigation, and MobileDrawer components
were all importing the `withOverride` function directly from the Navigator
component, creating a problematic dependency:

```
Navigator.tsx ← Brand.tsx (Child importing from parent)
```

## Solution: Shared Utility Pattern

I've moved the `withOverride` function to a dedicated utility file:

```
utils/component.ts
```

Now all components import this utility from a shared location:

```
utils/component.ts → Navigator.tsx
                   → Brand.tsx
                   → Actions.tsx
                   → etc.
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Prevents Circular Dependencies**: Clean, acyclic dependency graph
2. **Respects Component Hierarchy**: Components don't depend on their parents
3. **Improves Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify components
4. **Enables Independent Testing**: Components can be tested in isolation

## Clean Dependency Flow

The new dependency structure follows a clear, one-way hierarchy:

```
types/
  ↓
utils/, theme/   (Shared utilities)
  ↓
context/        (Context providers)
  ↓
hooks/          (Hooks that use context)
  ↓
components/     (Components that use hooks & utils)
```

This structure ensures that dependencies flow in one direction, following best
practices for React component architecture.

## Additional Improvements

I've also:

1. Properly separated `useMediaQuery` into its own file
2. Updated `useResponsive` to import the separate `useMediaQuery` hook
3. Made import paths consistent across all components
4. Updated the main index file to export from the correct locations

These changes collectively provide a much more maintainable codebase without
circular dependencies.

# Fixed Component Dependencies

I've addressed the component dependency issue you identified and created a
better file structure with proper dependency hierarchy:

## Key Issue Fixed: Child Components Importing from Parent

The problem was that child components (Brand, Actions, Navigation, MobileDrawer)
were importing the `withOverride` function directly from the Navigator
component, which:

1. Creates circular dependencies
2. Violates component hierarchy
3. Makes components unnecessarily coupled

## Solution: Shared Utility Function

I've moved the `withOverride` function to a dedicated utility file:

```
next/utils/component.ts
```

Now all components import this utility from the shared location instead of from
the Navigator component. This:

1. Eliminates potential circular dependencies
2. Respects proper component hierarchy
3. Improves code organization and maintainability

## Clean Dependency Flow

The new dependency structure follows a clear, one-way hierarchy:

```
types/ 
↓ 
theme/, utils/ <- Shared utilities that don't depend on components 
↓
context/ <- Context providers 
↓ 
hooks/ <- Hooks that use context 
↓ 
components/ <- Components that use hooks & utils
```

This creates a clean, acyclic dependency graph that's much easier to maintain
and less prone to circular dependency issues.

## Updated Components

I've updated:

- Brand.tsx
- Actions.tsx
- Navigation.tsx
- MobileDrawer.tsx
- Navigator.tsx

All now import `withOverride` from `../utils/component` instead of from the
Navigator component.
