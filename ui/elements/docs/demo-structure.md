We have been working on developing a set of data-driven and opinionated elements
and package it as `@m5nv/ui-elements` to be published to `npm`. The core code
and documentation is mostly done and we are now just crossing the "t"s and
dotting the "i". We are doing that by examining the versatility of the elements
package by building a "demo app" consisting of 4 routes to "pages" using
react-router framework mode.

One of the issues that we had to resolve was that `MegaDropdown` menu was not
cognizant of the available width. While investigating it we stumbled on the
question whether we should use container queries for widgets to be truly
responsive to the available container width. Since our `@m5nv/ui-elements` are
designed to be data-driven and opinionated, it felt like we should revisit the
`@m5nv/ui-elements/styles` for all widgets and see if they could benefit from
css container queries.

MegaDropdown, Pagination, SearchBox, Header, Table, List, almost all could
benefit container query based rendition. I was not sure if you were capable of
taking on such a huge task.

You (yes, you Claude), stepped up to the challenge and converted
`@m5nv/ui-elements` to use container queries. And you updated all the
react-router (v7, framework mode) page components, `root.tsx` and `layout.tsx`

Here is what you delivered:

## 🔧 Theme & Persistence System

```typescript
// Automatic theme restoration in root.tsx
const savedPalette = localStorage.getItem("ui-elements-palette") || "ghibli";
const savedTheme = localStorage.getItem("ui-elements-theme") || "light";

document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-palette", savedPalette);
document.documentElement.setAttribute("data-theme", savedTheme);
```

## 🎯 Container Query Highlights

1. **MegaDropdown**: 4 columns → 3 → 2 → 1 with smart overflow detection
2. **Table**: Full columns → progressive hiding → card layout
3. **ActionBar**: Full labels → compact → icons only
4. **Navigation**: Full dropdowns → compact → mobile menu
5. **All components**: Intelligent content prioritization

## 🌐 Routes & Navigation

- **`/`** - Home with container query hero
- **`/showcase`** - Interactive container query demos
- **`/dashboard`** - Business dashboard with responsive metrics
- **`/ecommerce`** - E-commerce with smart product layouts
- **`/settings`** - Theme management and configuration

## 🎨 Multi-Palette Theme System

5 complete palettes × 2 themes = **10 total combinations**:

- 🌿 **Ghibli** (natural sage)
- 💙 **Blue** (professional)
- 💜 **Purple** (creative)

And here is my feedback:

I get your enthusiasm. But I want you to tone it down on the marketing fluff.
Nothing these days is revolutionary. Container queries have been around since
your great grand dad was born (figuratively speaking). Stay focussed on
delivering functionality, robustness and meaning. Don't waste tokens on
marketing fluff.

With that said, here are various issues I found:

- You changed the home page; the previous one (see screenshot) was better
- The paginator doesn't do what you claim it does
- The cards in cardlayout when a table is in a narrow container are not
  responsive
- Not exactly sure what the resize bar is for as it does nothing
- The container query show case seems to be more trouble than a benefit; I only
  added it to the routes because you enthusiastically created it without
  consulting with me, and I like an idiot went along with your idiocy; and now
  we are both wasting our time.
- While the positioning issue of the MegaDropdown is fixed, somewhere you messed
  up by not honoring the css theme/palette scheme that is in place. Also, in the
  version I gave you both Electronics and Clothing were of MegaDropdown kind;
  but in the latest code only Electronics is. (see screenshot)
- I am not sure if in the Settings, the Disclosure (Collapsible?) is behaving
  correctly; is something supposed to happen when I click on the icon on top
  right?
- I already told you once that none of the widgets take `style` prop, and yet
  you seem to forget that and generated code as below, which suggests that we
  should evaluate the Card design and see if we should add props for frequent
  use cases that is making you reach for `style` prop (this is low priority, do
  not get sidetracked):
  ```tsx
  {/* In routes/home.tsx - Call to Action */}
  <Card variant="elevated" padding="lg" style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
    ...
  </Card>;

  {/* in routes/showcase.tsx */}
  <Card
    variant="outlined"
    padding="lg"
    className="showcase-container"
    style={{
      width: activeDemo === "megadropdown" ? `${containerWidth}px` : "100%",
      maxWidth: "100%",
      margin: "0 auto",
      transition: "width 0.3s ease",
    }}
  >
    {renderDemo()}
  </Card>;
  ```

  Objectives for this session:
  - Make a decision to either fix or keep `showcase.tsx`
  - Revert Home Page to be like the earlier version
  - Fix the burger menu to be like in the screenshot
  - Fix the MegaDrowndown menu to have proper backgrounds for light/dark mode
    and for all palettes
  - Fix the cards to have proper layout (use grid?) to keep the buttons aligned
