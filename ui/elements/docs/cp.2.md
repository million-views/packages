# Container Query Implementation Fix - Continuation Prompt

## Context & Background

You are working on `@m5nv/ui-elements`, a React component library with
**comprehensive container query support**. The library has been mostly
implemented but has **lingering issues** that prevent container queries from
working properly. You are in the middle of fixing a React Router v7 demo
application that showcases these components.

## Current Problem State

It is _unclear_ whether the lingering issues are in the library or in the demo
page components. In addition some of the component pages (ecommerce for example)
that were rendered correctly rendering previously now look messed up. The layout
and spacing of the demo page components are inconsistent, and do not look
professional. Multiple components claim to be container-aware but don't actually
adapt to their container width.

Here are the specific issues:

### Critical Issues:

1. **Demo page components**:
   - vertical spacing between sections is not consistent
   - cards and other elements within sections are not aligned properly

2. **ActionBar Container Queries**:
   - ActionBar is rendering vertically instead of horizontally
   - We implemented wrapper architecture with `.mv-actionbar-container` and
     discovered that adding `min-width: 600px;` to `.mv-action-bar-container`
     renders the `ActionBar` horizontally
   - The fix might need more thinking because at the end of the day it is not
     just about rendering horizontally but also be able to show various levels
     of detail at various container inline-size.
   - Future Idea: `direction` prop for intentional vertical/horizontal modes,
     not just for `ActionBar` but for other widgets where it makes sense.

3. **MegaDropdown Theme Issues**:
   - Could use better styling to clearly show the drop down
   - Perhaps a different surface color might help delineate when active

4. **Ecommerce demo page component**:
   - Completely broken; from card display to megadropdown to sidebard toast on
     "Add to card" click

5. **Sidebar/Drawer**:
   - The menu items previously used {icon, title, description}; now it displays
     only the {title}.
   - We need the old behavior back.
   - NOTE: This could be because of the width of the sidebar preventing the
     details from being displayed

## Files being made available to you:

- `@m5nv/ui-elements/styles.css` - **Complete container query CSS rewrite**
- `@m5nv/ui-elements/index.tsx` - **Fix component logic issues**
- `routes/home.tsx` - Fix layout/spacing issues
- `routes/showcase.tsx` - Make it do what it claims it does; the megadropdown
  demo is broken and other areas could benefit from a review
- Review `app/styles/global.css` - Check for CSS conflicts

## Success Criteria:

When fixed, these behaviors should work:

1. **Browser resize test**: Resize browser window → components adapt to
   container width; container of widgets only take up as much space as the
   widgets need.
2. **Table test**: Narrow container → table switches to card layout with, for
   example, "Name: John Doe, Role: Designer, <column-name>: <cell-value>" format
3. **MegaDropdown test**: The styling is fixed and the megadropdown is clearly
   visible visually
4. **Showcase test**: Each section does what it claims it can do

## Instructions for Continuation:

1. **Analyze provided files** thoroughly - understand current broken state
2. **Regenerate core library files** completely - don't patch, rebuild
   foundation - if issues are found.
3. **Test each container query claim** - ensure they actually work when browser
   resizes
4. **Fix demo page consistency** - ensure all pages use components properly
   (using consistent layout and spacing)
5. **Pay attention** - none of the widgets in `elements` library accept `style`
   prop; you seem to be forgetting this and start using `style` prop in the demo
   page components. Also, avoid `div soup`; ideally the demo page components
   should have as little markup as needed.

## Files You Have Access To:

- All current `@m5nv/ui-elements` source files (styles.css, index.tsx)
- All React Router v7 demo application files
- Global CSS file (`app/style/global.css`)

## Development Approach:

This is a **dog-fooding exercise** - the demo pages should be simple because the
data-driven UI elements should do the heavy lifting. Focus on making the core
library components actually work as advertised, then ensure demo pages use them
correctly.

The **dog-fooding exercise** should clearly demonstrate that application
developers need very little css to get going. So, what and how much of css is
present in `app/style/global.css` matters. Also the number of `div`s present in
the demo code matters too.

Do not generate any debugging or additional code without consulting with me. You
can use me as your manual tester. The idea here is to preserve your output
tokens to write functional code not waste it on throwaway or debug code.

**Priority**: Fix the `ActionBar` styling issues (horizontal vs vertical; be
responsive to container inline-size to display only what can fit).
