# @m5nv/ui-elements - Project Status & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### Critical Fixes Applied:

1. **ActionBar Container Queries** - Fixed horizontal rendering and responsive
   behavior
2. **MegaDropdown Intelligence** - Responsive behavior with 6 adaptation levels
   (still needs some tweaks to be more adaptive)
3. **Navigation Drawer** - Increased width (380px) and descriptions now display
   properly
4. **Demo Page Cleanup** - Removed style props, consistent spacing using
   semantic classes (there may still be some stragglers)
5. **E-commerce Demo** - Fixed layout and cart functionality

### Working Features:

- ActionBar adapts: labels ‚Üí icons ‚Üí compact based on container width
- MegaDropdown: 5 cols ‚Üí 4 cols ‚Üí 3 cols ‚Üí 2 cols ‚Üí 1 col ‚Üí list mode
- Navigation drawer shows icons, labels, AND descriptions
- Featured sections display properly

## üéØ PENDING HIGH-PRIORITY TASKS

### 1. **Direction Prop Implementation** (USER REQUESTED)

**Goal**: Add `direction` prop for intentional vertical/horizontal layout
control

**Components to Update**:

- `ActionBar` - Primary candidate for horizontal/vertical modes
- `List` - Could benefit from horizontal card layout mode
- `TabGroup` - Vertical tabs for sidebars
- `Breadcrumbs` - Vertical breadcrumbs for narrow spaces
- `Pagination` - Vertical pagination for sidebars

**Implementation Needs**:

```typescript
interface DirectionalProps {
  direction?: "horizontal" | "vertical" | "auto"; // auto = responsive
}
```

**CSS Structure Needed**:

```css
.mv-actionbar--horizontal {
  /* flex-direction: row */
}
.mv-actionbar--vertical {
  /* flex-direction: column */
}
.mv-actionbar--auto {
  /* responsive container queries */
}
```

### 2. **Container Query Audit** (CRITICAL)

**Problem**: Other components claim container-aware behavior but may not
actually work

**Components to Test & Fix**:

- `List` - Does it hide descriptions/icons in narrow containers?
- `TabGroup` - Does it handle overflow and hide elements properly?
- `Pagination` - Does it adapt layout and hide page info?
- `Table` - Does it switch to card layout with proper data-label attributes?
- `CollapsibleSection` - Does spacing adapt to container width?

**Testing Protocol**:

1. Browser resize test - components should adapt to container, not viewport
2. Nested container test - components in narrow sidebar should adapt differently
   than full-width
3. Breakpoint verification - ensure claimed breakpoints actually trigger
4. **Do not write any test/debug code**; use human in the loop to perform manual
   testing

### 3. **Demo Page Consistency** (MEDIUM)

**Issues Identified**:

- Vertical spacing between sections inconsistent
- Cards and elements within sections not properly aligned
- Some pages still use div soup instead of semantic structure

** Demo Layout and Pages to Review**:

- `app/root.tsx` - Look for **dog-fooding** opportunities; minimize raw html
- `app/routes/layout.tsx` - Look for **dog-fooding** opportunities; minimize
  conditional JSX expressions by making use of function components.
- `app/routes/home.tsx` - Layout spacing issues
- `app/routes/showcase.tsx` - Claims vs reality verification
- `app/routes/dashboard.tsx` - Table/pagination integration
- `app/routes/settings.tsx` - May need updating to match patterns
- `app/styles/global.css` - Should demonstrate that webapps can be built with
  very little css using `@m5nv/ui-elements`

## üö® CRITICAL LAYOUT ISSUES (SCREENSHOTS PROVIDED)

### 1. **Select Component Dropdown Clipping**

- **Issue**: Select dropdown lists getting cut off/clipped by parent containers
- **Evidence**: Screenshot shows filter dropdown being clipped at bottom
- **Root Cause**: Parent container has `overflow: hidden` or incorrect
  positioning context
- **Priority**: HIGH - Users can't see all dropdown options

### 2. **Card Layout Alignment Problems**

- **Issue**: "Add to Cart" buttons not aligned across product cards
- **Evidence**: Screenshot shows buttons at different heights
- **Root Cause**: Variable content height without proper CSS Grid alignment
- **Priority**: HIGH - Unprofessional appearance

### 3. **Sidebar Layout Collapse**

- **Issue**: When "Show Filters" clicked, product grid layout breaks
- **Evidence**: Screenshot shows cards change aspect ratio/layout when sidebar
  opens
- **Root Cause**: Grid system not handling sidebar state transitions properly
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core e-commerce functionality broken

### 4. **Header Layout Structure Issues**

- **Issue**: ActionBar not properly right-aligned in header
- **Evidence**: Header layout appears unbalanced
- **User Request**: Header should use CSS Grid with named areas for proper
  control
- **Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects overall app navigation UX

### 5. **Container Query Reliability**

- **Issue**: Components claiming container-awareness may not be working properly
- **Evidence**: Layout breaks suggest responsive behavior is inconsistent
- **Priority**: HIGH - Core value proposition of the library

## ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUES TO MONITOR

### 1. **API Consistency**

- **Risk**: Props and behavior inconsistencies across components
- **Examples**: Some use `size`, others use `variant`; some use `responsive`,
  others don't
- **Solution**: Audit and standardize prop naming conventions

## üìã CLEAR NEXT STEPS (REPRIORITIZED)

### **STEP 1: Critical Layout Fixes** ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT

**I Need From You**:

1. **Confirm priority order** - Which breaks the user experience most?
2. **Expected behavior** - How should sidebar transition work?
3. **Header layout vision** - Specific grid areas you want (brand | search |
   actions)?

**Issues to Fix Immediately**:

1. **Select dropdown clipping** - Ensure dropdowns escape parent container
   bounds
2. **Card button alignment** - Fix "Add to Cart" buttons to align at bottom
3. **Sidebar grid behavior** - Prevent layout collapse when filters show
4. **Header ActionBar alignment** - Implement proper right alignment

**Files I'll Update**:

- `styles.css` - Select dropdown positioning, card alignment, grid behavior
- `global.css` - Header grid system with named areas
- `ecommerce.tsx` - Sidebar state management
- `layout.tsx` - Header structure improvement

### **STEP 2: Direction Prop Implementation** üéØ HIGH VALUE

**I Need From You**:

1. **Which components** should get `direction` prop? (ActionBar confirmed,
   others?)
2. **Default behavior** - should `direction="auto"` be default (responsive) or
   `"horizontal"`?
3. **Naming preference** - `direction`, `orientation`, or `layout`?

**Files I'll Update**:

- `index.tsx` - Component interfaces and logic
- `styles.css` - CSS classes for directional layouts
- Demo pages - Examples of vertical/horizontal usage

### **STEP 3: Container Query Audit** üîç RELIABILITY

**I Need From You**:

1. **Priority order** - which components are most critical to fix first?
2. **Testing scope** - should I test all breakpoints or focus on major ones?
3. **Failure tolerance** - if a component can't be made truly responsive, is a
   simpler fallback acceptable?

**My Deliverables**:

- Test results for each component's responsive claims
- Fixed implementations for broken container queries
- Updated documentation of actual vs claimed behavior

## üí¨ READY TO PROCEED

**URGENT: Critical Layout Fixes First** Based on your screenshots, these issues
are breaking core functionality:

1. **MegaDropdown clipping** - Users can't see full navigation
2. **Misaligned buttons** - Looks unprofessional
3. **Broken sidebar grid** - E-commerce filtering is unusable
4. **Header alignment** - Navigation feels unbalanced

**Tell me**:

1. **Should I fix the layout issues first** before adding new features?
2. **Header grid structure** - Do you want specific named areas like
   `[brand search actions]`?
3. **Card alignment strategy** - Should all cards have equal height, or just
   align buttons at bottom?
4. **Sidebar transition behavior** - Should product grid reflow smoothly or snap
   to new layout?

**Then we can move to**:

- Direction prop implementation
- Container query audit
- Demo polish

I'm ready to deliver **working, professional layouts** that actually function
properly across all scenarios.
